# JustJava
First Android coding project from Udacity

Just started following the Introduction to Android course and greatly enjoying it. There are, however, points where I want to experiment with the code and do things differently from the course instructions to learn more, but I also want to be able to go back and follow along if my changes deviate too much from the course. Seems like the perfect opportunity to learn version control!
